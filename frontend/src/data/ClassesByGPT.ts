 * at their applicable class levels. Editorial labels identify reference data
 * and optional choices; they do not grant extra features.
 *
 * Schema conventions:
 * - HitPointDie is the die size (for example, 12 means d12).
 * - Proficiencies describes starting-class proficiencies, before optional
 *   features and subclass choices. Core-trait entries preserve tool training
 *   and restricted Martial weapon proficiencies that the schema cannot express.
 * - Features includes progression tables, spell lists and conditional choices
 *   as explicitly named reference entries. Spell-list entries do not grant all
 *   spells at the reference entry's level; follow their spell levels and the
 *   class's preparation/learning rules. Spell descriptions remain in the SRD.
 * - Subclass entries apply only if that named subclass is chosen. Only the one
 *   subclass per class actually published in this SRD is included.
 * - Fighter's three equipment choices are preserved by grouping its two
 *   equipment loadouts into Choose.A and putting its gold-only option in Choose.B.
 * - likes and Complexity come from the SRD Class Overview, not generated ratings.

Damage Resistance. You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

Rage Damage. When you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike—and deal damage
to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in
the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.

Strength Advantage. You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

No Concentration or Spells. You can’t maintain Concentration, and you can’t cast spells.

Duration. The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the
Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another
round by doing one of the following:

• Make an attack roll against an enemy.

• Force an enemy to make a saving throw.

• Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage. Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next
turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.

When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as

Spell Slots. The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You
regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list. Charm Person, Color Spray,
Dissonant Whispers, and Healing Word are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of
the Bard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list
until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level

include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the
number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.

Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with
another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.

Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.

information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the Cleric spell list

Cantrips. You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. Guidance, Sacred Flame, and
Thaumaturgy are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice
from the Cleric spell list.

When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as
shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.

Spell Slots. The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You
regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list. Bless, Cure Wounds, Guiding
Bolt, and Shield of Faith are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column
of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell
list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a
level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells
can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the
number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.

Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells,
replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.

Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.

spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the
Druid spell list later in the class’s description.

Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. Druidcraft and Produce Flame are
recommended.

Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from
the Druid spell list.

When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as
shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.

Spell Slots. The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You
regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list. Animal Friendship, Cure Wounds,
Faerie Fire, and Thunderwave are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column
of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell
list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a
level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can
include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the
number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.

Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells,
replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.

Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.

condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.

Number of Uses. You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and
you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid
Features table.

Known Forms. You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a
maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see “Animals” in “Monsters” for stat block
options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider, and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can
replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.

When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those
forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form
that has a Fly Speed.

When choosing known forms, you may look in other sources for eligible Beasts if the Game Master permits you to
do so.

Beast Shapes
Druid Level | Known Forms | Maximum CR | Fly Speed
2 | 4 | 1/4 | No
4 | 6 | 1/2 | No
8 | 8 | 1 | Yes

Rules While Shape-Shifted. While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and
the following rules apply: Temporary Hit Points. When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of
Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level. Game Statistics. Your game statistics are replaced by the
Beast’s stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw
proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the
creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher than yours, use the one in
the stat block. No Spellcasting. You can’t cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn’t break your Concentration or
otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast. Objects. Your ability to handle objects is determined by
the form’s limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space,
merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether
it’s practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature’s size and shape. Your
equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear
must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while
you’re in that form.

have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (round up), and none of them can be
level 6+. For example, if you’re a level 6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels’ worth of spell slots.
You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level 2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots. Once
you recover spell slots with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

Spell Slots. The Paladin Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You
regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells. Heroism and Searing Smite are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column
of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Paladin spells until the
number of spells on your list matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen spells must be of a
level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells
can include six Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against
the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for
you.

Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with
another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.

Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.`

Spell Slots. The Ranger Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You
regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest. Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of
level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger
spells. Cure Wounds and Ensnaring Strike are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column
of the Ranger Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Ranger spells until the number
of spells on your list matches the number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level
for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can
include six Ranger spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the
number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you.

Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with
another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells.

Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.`

information below details how you use those rules with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the Sorcerer spell
list later in the class’s description.

Cantrips. You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. Light, Prestidigitation, Shocking Grasp, and
Sorcerous Burst are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from
this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the
Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table.

Spell Slots. The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You
regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. Burning Hands and Detect Magic are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until
the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be
of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared
spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against
the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells
for you.

Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with
another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.

Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.`

Prerequisites. If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if
an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock
level 5.

Replacing and Gaining Invocations. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations
with another one for which you qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another
invocation that you have.

When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations

“Spells” for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock
spells, which appear in the Warlock spell list later in the class’s description.

Cantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recommended.
Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock
cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the
Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.

Spell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of
levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all
expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Charm
Person, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. Charm Person and Hex are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column
of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the
number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher
than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you
learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3.

If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against
the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for
you.

Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with
another Warlock spell of an eligible level.

Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.

Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.`

information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the Wizard spell list
later in the class’s description.

Cantrips. You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. Light, Mage Hand, and Ray of Frost are recommended.
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard
cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the
Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.

Spellbook. Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a
Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting Identify.
You determine the book’s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound
with twine.

The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice.
Detect Magic, Feather Fall, Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Sleep, and Thunderwave are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of
these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The
spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.

Spell Slots. The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You
regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column
of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number
of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you
have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells
of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.

If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the
number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.

Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells,
replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.

Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard
spells.`

Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if

transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your

Copying the Book. You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell
into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and
10 GP for each level of the copied spell.

If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have
prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do
so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.`
